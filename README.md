# Tripp - Legacy Project.

The goal of this project was to practice architecting a project and thinking about things like which tech stack to use, where to store files, etc. In this regards, this project is complete. It is incomplete in the sense that it is not a fully-fledged, usable application :)

### Learnings

1. While CRA is a create tool for quickly scaffolding a project, it becomes overly complicated when trying to integrate a custom backend. For me the reason for this is that CRA abstracts away all the tooling, meaning I didn't know what decisions it was making for me behind the scenes, and without this knowledge figuring out how to proxy requests to my Express server was difficult

    - I think for future projects I will use some other tool for quickly scaffolding React projects, like for example Next.js, or I will do all the tooling myself.

2. Going into a project with only a vague idea of the finished product makes it difficult to finish the product.

    - In the future I will spend more time drawing out the whole flow of the project, and critically thinking about what the goal of the project is. I think these will help me create more succinct products, and help me to finish them

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
